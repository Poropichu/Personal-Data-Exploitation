# Personal-Data-Exploitation
The problem of using personal data online to perform cashless transactions
In this digitalised world, many of us rely on bank cards to shop online. With just a simple touch from our smartphones and computer, we can purchase almost anything online easily in a few seconds. We believe that there are many security systems put into place such as 2FA, signatures, etc. However, with the recent rise of cyberhackers and scammers in this digitalised world, is it entirely safe to put our personal details such as credit card information online to perform internet transactions?

The problem of personal data being breached has always been a problem. Back in 2005, forty million credit card numbers were hacked and reports state that “a specific virus to capture customer data was used in the fraud”.

One of the solutions to protect personal data is the use of 2FA. 2FA is an enhanced authentication mechanism for protecting users that have their password stolen either by leaking a server’s password database or phishing. However, there are still problems that hinder the roll-out of 2FA such as scalability and usability.

The first problem of scalability is that 2FA is less prevalent or secure in less-developed countries where access to new technology is limited. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, many people used mobile money system service (MMS) to send and receive money digitally. However, because of the lack of complex 2FA in these less developed countries, MMS was prone to various cyber attacks and the data in MMS were easily compromised.

Usability is also a problem in 2FA, which restricts one from enjoying the user experience. A study conducted by Ganson et al, asked mobile users to rate on their experience based on the ease and how they felt based on 1FA and 2FA. He mentioned that the participants took more than 20 seconds for the 2FA and was quite a hassle and hindrance for them while 1FA was much quicker. 2FA appears to users to be a more secure solution but less easy to use. That is the reason why some people, especially the elderly, refuse to use 2FA as they are not as tech-savvy as the younger generation and hence most of their personal data has a higher chance of being leaked or phished.

Nonetheless, there is still a fair share of credit card transactions that require 2FA, however is 2FA actually really that safe?

2FA can be hacked involuntarily or voluntarily. One way a user can get hacked involuntarily is through the download of malicious apps or dangerous website links. Some of these malicious apps include battery optimisation apps, cryptocurrency miner, free & easy money, etc. These apps usually contain an Android Trojan that hides inside the battery optimisation app and steals money from their Paypal account by tricking them to open their Paypal. It can even read or send messages on their phone without the user knowing, rendering 2FA useless.

Personal information can be hacked voluntarily in the sense that the user provides the 2FA to the hacker whom he or she believes is trusted. For example, back in December 2018, there were phishing attacks across the Middle East and North Africa, which targeted journalists and activists by using fake emails and login pages. Some users were then tricked into giving up their personal login information even though they had 2FA security in place.

Even so, sometimes we believe that credit/debit card transactions are safe because they require a PIN. For example, a customer goes to the supermarket and pays for his transaction using his credit card. A few months later, the supermarket informs him that due to a software bug on their card-reading machines, his data might have been leaked. The customer thought that everything was safe but because PayWave does not need a 6 digit PIN code, his credentials might have already been leaked online. The hacker might also be performing transactions online using his credit card information without even him knowing.

In conclusion, the problem of using personal data cannot be entirely safe. Similarly, the use of security systems to protect our personal data is not always fool-proof, user friendly and applicable. Hence, we should innovate better security systems that not only protect user data, it should also improve the overall customer experience.
